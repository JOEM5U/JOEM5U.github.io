            <p id="Question">1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I first waited for the site to load which displayed a dark screen saying ‘It is now safe to turn off your computer’
                </li><br>
                <li>I then looked at the various pop ups which where sliding across the screen and began clicking on them</li>
                <br>
                <li>As I clicked on the pop ups  a browser message popped up stating ‘x marks the spot’</li><br>
                <li>I then clicked on the close button on the various pop up windows on the site and was led to a new page which began playing a video</li><br>
                <li>I then scanned the page where music began playing and immediately closed the tab after reading the pop up that my ‘computer was infected’.</li><br>
                <li>I then began spam clicking on various boxes and text on the website which spawned cookie gifs and error sounds after multiple attempts to close them.</li><br>
                <li>I then clicked on the email tab and typed random letter into it, then entered it in which made that pop up window vanish.</li><br>
                <Li>I then decided to tap on the monkey gif which gave a type of warning message with another monkey gif.</Li><br>
                <li>I decided to press “Do it cybermonkey” which ended up closing the site after displaying spamming the page with pop ups and flashing screens.</li><br>
            </ul>
            <p id="Question">2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>
            <p id="Answer">The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the site was the brief loading screen that stated "It is now safe t turn off you computer" in large orange pixalated text, then the monstrous amount of pop up windows in the site.</p>
            <p id="Question">3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>
            <p id="Answer">I spent the most time engaging with the small windows trying to close them and avoid the other pop up text on the actual window.</p>
            <p id="Question">4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
            <p id="Answer">The most common action within my two minute interaction was clicking the close button ‘x’ on the small windows.</p>
            <p id="Question">5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>
            <p id="Answer">I believe the intended goal of the interactive experience is to generate a sense of fear and panic within the user/ the person that is interacting with the website. Furthermore this site’s goal could be to educate individuals to be careful on what sites they click on.</p>
            <p id="Question">6) How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</p>
            <p id="Answer">The experience communicates its primary goal through the old windows style website aesthetic. This is enhanced through the use of error audio when interacting with the pop up messages. Furthermore this site is laid out like a website filled with a virus through the pop up messages and erratic moving gifs.</p>
            <p id="Question">7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</p>
            <p id="Answer">I believe that the intended length for a single interaction would be around 3-4 minutes with the intention of having to interact with it once or twice. Within this timeframe it would allow the viewer to grasp the situation they are in with the website but also give the impression of a fast acting virus on the internet which is chaotic. </p>
            <h2>WEEK 3 QUESTIONS</h><br>
           
            <p id="Question">8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</p>
            <p id="Answer">The experience’s mental model references the old window style computers which were highly pixelated. However in the current modern society these metaphors relate to having a virus on the computer as it looks foreign. </p>
            <p id="Question">9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</p>
            <p id="Answer">This reference makes me  feel frustrated however at the same time I feel scared as it looks and acts similar to a way a computer virus would act. When engaging with this site the various pop ups are engineered to surprise the user and cause panic. This is combined by the real pop ups from the browser itself which adds to the sense of chaos and heightens the feeling of fear and distress.</p>
            <p id="Question">10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</p>
            <p id="Answer">The most frustrating element of this interaction were the pop up messages whenever I tried to close a tab and how the windows in the interaction would not close immediately. Another frustrating element would be the moving windows which were hard to click on, however would display another browser message when clicked upon.</p>
            <p id="Question">11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?</p>
            <p id="Answer">The most satisfying element of the interaction would be clicking on the monkey gif as it was the only thing which had an immediate response to it compared to other elements of the website. Furthermore it was the only element that immediately ended the chaotic scene of the website.</p>
